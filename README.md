# vetapp

VetApp is an mobile application designed for a Veterinary Clinic. Users will have to log into the application using their accounts. If they do not have accounts, they can create one from the login page. Once they have logged in, they will be able to book new appointments for their pets, and track their petâ€™s past appointments and health details. The application will also send reminders to the user, via push notifications, to remind them of upcoming appointments. The vet is also able to send push notifications to users, via the Firebase Console, to inform them about vaccinations, or other information.

In addition to the application, a website was created so that the vet is able to access data from the database without logging into PHPMyAdmin. 

This project was completed on 7 February 2019 for the Mobile Device Applications Development module.
